# Overview of the Election Audit

For this project, we were approached by oiur friend Tom, who is an employee at the Colorado Board of Elections. He asked for assistance in auditing a recent US Congressional Precinct election by conducting a vote count report to certify the election. THis process is usually domne in Excel, but they want to know if the procedures can be automated in Python. If it's successful, the code that Tom and I put tiogether could be used in the future for elections in other Congressional districts, in addition to Senatorial districts as well as local elections.

The dataset that we had access to included all votes cast in the election. There were three pieces of information for each volte:
- Ballot ID
- The county that the vote was cast in
- The candidate that the vote was cast for
